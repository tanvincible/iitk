# IITK Study Material

Welcome to my **IIT Kanpur** study material repository!  
This repository contains the notes, study materials, and resources I’ve compiled throughout 2025-2027 as a [**Mechanical Engineering (MechE) UG**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/me/) student at [**IIT Kanpur**](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).  
It includes lecture notes, tutorial solutions, project reports, and any other academic resources I’ve found useful in my courses.

I aim to keep this repository up-to-date and continuously add new materials as the semester progresses.
